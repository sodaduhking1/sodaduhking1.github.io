    <title>My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.</title>

      <p style="color:orange;">Hello I am Sodaduhking (Soda.duh.king) 
        I'm an alone psychotic schizophrenic substance abuser 
        attempting to kickstart an internet career so I can feel l
        ike someone out there hears me 
        and cares about my existance for once I need help but i
        won't recieve the help I need because I'm too mentally 
        fucked nothing will help I've attempted suicide twice
        but failed both times someone please just fucking kill me I have a past in criminal activity doxxing/swatting/pizza bombing/ratting etc...
        I have failed so many people in my life I want a chance at something more I kind of just want a reset in life 
        I want everyone to forget all the horrible shit I've done in the past I'm alone and only have like five people that I can talk to
      I want someone to love me as much as I love them but I cant see that happening my carrer path I've chosen will most likely fail and I probably won't live past 19
      I've felt lost, unheard, not important for the past decade and no matter what I do I always feel alone I've tried having relationships making friends talking to people 
      but nothing helps me I'm a peice of shit and no matter what I do I cant seem to get better I've ruined everything I've ever had

      I've had multiple other websites but this is my main site right now
      I'm problematic but thats what makes me me
      I hate myself with every fucking fibor of my being
      I'm currently going to therapy but that shit doesnt help in the slightest
      I'll probably be sent to a psych ward at some point in my life but hey I guess thats life
      I'm currently at home because I dropped out of school early because I cant fucking stand that place
      I hate my life, and I hope someone can fucking kill me.
      Sometimes I feel so alone
      I just don't know
      Feels like I've been down this road before
      So lonely and cold
      It's like something takes over me as soon as I go home and close the door</p>
